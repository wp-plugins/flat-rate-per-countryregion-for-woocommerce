This plugin allows you to set a flat delivery rate per country and/or region on WooCommerce.

== Description ==
If you need a simple way to specify a delivery flat rate, based on the country and/or world region of the buyer, on WooCommerce for WordPress, this plugin is for you!

A simple example of this plugin usage is to set a value for delivery in your own country (e.g. Portugal), a different value for your continent (e.g. Europe) and a third one for the rest of the world.

=Features:=

* Create any number of countries groups and set a specific delivery rate for each group;
* Create any number of world regions groups and set a specific delivery rate for each group;
* Specify a fallback "Rest of the World" rate for any destinations not on the groups;
