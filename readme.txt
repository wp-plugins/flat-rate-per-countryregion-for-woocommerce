This plugin allows you to set a flat delivery rate per States, Countries or World Regions on WooCommerce.

== Description ==

If you need a simple way to specify a delivery flat rate, based on the state and/or country and/or world region of the delivery address, on WooCommerce for WordPress, this plugin is for you!

A simple example of this plugin usage is to set a value for delivery in a specific state (e.g. Lisbon), the rest of your own country (e.g. Portugal), a different value for your continent (e.g. Europe) and a last one for the rest of the world.

You can create groups for states, countries and world regions and specify delivery rates for them.

For each group you can choose either to apply the shipping fee for the whole order or multiply it per each item. You can also set a total order value from which the shipping will be free.

= Features: =

* Create any number of states groups/rules and set a specific delivery rate for each group;
* Create any number of countries groups/rules and set a specific delivery rate for each group;
* Create any number of world regions groups/rules and set a specific delivery rate for each group;
* Specify a fallback "Rest of the World" rate for any destinations not specified on the groups;
* For each group/rule, apply the shipping fee for the whole order or multiply it per each item;
* For each group/rule, set total order value from which the shipping is free;

== Installation ==

Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for "Flat Rate per Country/Region for WooCommerce".
